# Reaparr Backend

## Purpose

This skill is mandatory for every Reaparr backend task. Always load `reaparr-backend` before reading, searching, editing, reviewing, debugging, planning, or testing backend code. Do not skip it because a narrower backend skill appears to match; load this skill first, then load the narrower skill.

It gives the shared backend map, mandatory tool rules, verification gates, logging rules, and routing to narrower skills.

Backend work includes code, tests, configuration, plans, reviews, debugging, and refactors under:
- `src/` except `src/AppHost/ClientApp/`
- `tests/UnitTests/`
- `tests/IntegrationTests/`
- backend project files, DI modules, migrations, settings, job config, endpoint contracts, and generated backend API surfaces

Do not use this skill for frontend-only work under `src/AppHost/ClientApp/`; use the Reaparr frontend skills instead.

## Vertical-slice structure

Application endpoints are organized by operation, not grouped into product-level aggregate files.

- Put each endpoint operation in its own descriptively named folder under the relevant feature/product area.
- Keep the endpoint, its request/response contracts, and its validator in that operation's endpoint file unless the existing slice uses separate files.
- A C# endpoint file must declare only one FastEndpoints endpoint class.
- Never create aggregate files such as `SonarrIntegrationEndpoints.cs`, `RadarrIntegrationEndpoints.cs`, `ManagementEndpoints.cs`, or any other `*Endpoints.cs` file containing multiple endpoint operations.
- When adding related detail, setup, and delete operations, create sibling slices such as `GetSonarrIntegration/`, `SetupSonarrIntegration/`, and `DeleteSonarrIntegration/` rather than grouping them by product in one file.
- Before creating files, inspect the nearest existing endpoint siblings through native repository tools and match their folder/file organization.

Generic minimal-file or DRY guidance must not override this structure. In Reaparr, the operation is the vertical slice.

## Required Tooling

Native repository tooling is mandatory for backend work. Use these tools directly:
- `read`, `edit`, and `write` for file operations;
- `glob` and repository search tools for discovery;
- `lsp` for symbol inspection, references, refactors, and diagnostics;
- short `bash` commands for native project tooling and factual checks;
- `dotnet-test-mcp` or the repository's native test command for backend tests.

### Uncommitted-change reviews

When asked to review, audit, or correct uncommitted backend changes:

- Use native repository tools to enumerate and inspect changed files, surrounding code, symbols, and usages.
- Apply corrections with native file-editing tools.
- Use native diagnostics and test tooling to validate the corrected change set.
- Preserve unrelated user changes and review every staged and unstaged backend change before claiming the audit is complete.

### Native tooling fast path

After one successful native tool call, reuse the same tool family for the task:

| Action | Native tool |
| --- | --- |
| Read file/range | `read` |
| Create or overwrite file | `write` |
| Surgical edit | `edit` |
| Find paths | `glob` |
| Symbol-aware lookup/refactor | `lsp` |
| Short project command | `bash` |
| Backend tests | `dotnet-test-mcp` or the repository's native test command |

Only switch tool families when a needed capability is unavailable or a native call fails.

### Native tooling retry rule

If a native tool fails, retry the same tool once with a narrower request before changing approach:
- File read fails -> read a smaller range.
- Search fails -> narrow the path or search term.
- Diagnostics fail -> retry the same file, then use narrower `lsp` diagnostics.
- Test execution fails -> preserve the failure evidence and retry through the repository's documented test route.

Do not treat an external editor integration as a prerequisite for backend work.

## Secondary Skill Routing

Load this skill first, then load narrower skills when the task matches. When editing or creating backend unit tests under `tests/UnitTests/`, `reaparr-backend-unit-tests` is mandatory, even if the production code being tested lives in a tooling project such as `tools/Build`. 

| Task | Load next |
| --- | --- |
| Command records, handlers, validators, command dispatch, `ICommandExecutor` | `reaparr-command-handler-patterns` |
| Backend unit tests under `tests/UnitTests/` | `reaparr-backend-unit-tests` |
| Backend integration tests under `tests/IntegrationTests/` | `reaparr-backend-integration-tests` |
| Broad .NET or C# implementation choices | `dotnet`, `modern-csharp`, or `dotnet-best-practices` |
| ASP.NET Core hosting, middleware, auth, API composition | `aspnet-core` or `dotnet-backend` |
| FastEndpoints endpoint design | `fast-endpoints` |
| EF Core modeling, migrations, query behavior, persistence | `entity-framework-core`, `ef-core`, or `optimizing-ef-core-queries` |
| SignalR hubs, clients, realtime delivery | `signalr` |
| TUnit mechanics or test runner behavior | `tunit` |
| Data access performance | `database-performance` |
| Retry, timeout, circuit breaker, fault tolerance | `resilience-patterns` |

Prefer Reaparr-specific skills over generic skills when both apply.

## Backend Architecture Map

| Area | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `src/AppHost` | Application host, startup/configuration, Autofac composition, FastEndpoints registration, SignalR setup, generated API surface, frontend hosting boundary |
| `src/Application` | Primary use cases, command handlers, orchestration, Plex download flows, API-facing application behavior |
| `src/Application.Contracts` | Cross-project commands, DTO contracts, request/response types consumed outside implementation assemblies |
| `src/Domain` | Domain entities, shared abstractions, FastEndpoints command executor abstractions, domain services and shared primitives |
| `src/Data` | EF Core contexts, persistence configuration, migrations/seeding, database-specific behavior |
| `src/BackgroundJobs` | Quartz jobs and background workflows; jobs dispatch commands and must not throw out of `Execute` |
| `src/BackgroundJobs.Contracts` | Contracts for background job commands and cross-project scheduling requests |
| `src/PlexApi` and contracts | Plex API clients, DTOs, and translation around Plex server/library/media operations |
| `src/External` | External-service integrations and adapters |
| `src/FileSystem` | File and path abstractions, filesystem-side media/download behavior |
| `src/Settings` | Strongly typed settings and configuration models |
| `src/Logging` | Serilog/logging support |
| `src/PublicApi` | Public API-facing contracts and integration boundaries |
| `tests/BaseTests` | Shared unit/integration test infrastructure, seed data, fake Plex data, mock filesystem/http helpers |

## Core Backend Patterns

### Endpoints

- Endpoints inherit from the project-local `BaseEndpoint<TRequest, TResponse>`.
- Do not inherit from raw FastEndpoints `Endpoint<,>` directly.
- Endpoint behavior should usually dispatch through `ICommandExecutor` rather than embedding orchestration logic.

### Dependency Injection

- Autofac modules use `*Module : Module`.
- Register modules through the existing AppHost composition path.
- Prefer existing services and abstractions before introducing new ones.

### Persistence

- EF Core access goes through project contexts/factories and existing repository/service patterns.
- Avoid application-side joins and unbounded queries.
- Do not add `.AsNoTracking()` to read queries; no-tracking is already the explicit default in Reaparr query configuration.
- Keep query behavior deterministic and testable.

### EF Core migrations

- Never hand-author, manually create, or manually edit EF Core migration files or `*ModelSnapshot.cs` files.
- Always generate migrations through MCP tooling with `dotnet-mcp:dotnet_ef` and `action: MigrationsAdd`.
- If a migration needs to be removed or regenerated, use `dotnet-mcp:dotnet_ef` with the appropriate migration action instead of deleting or rewriting files by hand.
- After MCP migration generation, inspect generated files and run native diagnostics on the changed model/configuration files before claiming completion.

### Background Jobs

- Quartz jobs use `IJob` and should be marked `[DisallowConcurrentExecution]` when concurrent execution is unsafe.
- Pass parameters through `JobDataMap`.
- Dispatch real work through `ICommandExecutor`.
- Jobs must catch, log, and swallow exceptions; do not let exceptions escape `Execute`.

### Realtime

- After MCP migration generation, inspect generated files and run native diagnostics on the changed model/configuration files before claiming completion.
- Broadcast through `IHubContext<THub, TClientInterface>.Clients.All` or the narrowest appropriate client target.

### Logging

- Use Serilog `ILogger` according to existing conventions.
- For command handlers and services, prefer assigning contextual loggers with `log.ForContext<T>()` when that is the local pattern.
- Every `_log` usage must include `.Here()` before the log-level call.

Good:

```csharp
_log.Here().Information("Refreshing Plex server access");
_log.Here().Error(ex, "Failed to queue library sync job");
```

Bad:

```csharp
_log.Information("Refreshing Plex server access");
_log.Error(ex, "Failed to queue library sync job");
```

## Result Handling

Reaparr uses `FluentResults` as the normal error boundary for commands, jobs, services, and other fallible backend operations. Preserve the distinction between success, cancellation, expected domain failures, and unexpected failures.

### Prefer `Result.Try` over `try/catch`

Use `Result.Try` before reaching for a manual `try/catch`. It is the standard project mechanism for converting thrown exceptions and cancelled operations into `Result` values.

```csharp
var result = await Result.Try(async Task () =>
{
    await DoWorkAsync(cancellationToken);
});
```

Use a manual `try/catch` only when `Result.Try` cannot express the required behavior, such as:
- translating a specific external exception into a specific HTTP or domain error;
- guaranteeing cleanup in `finally`;
- containing exceptions at framework boundaries such as Quartz listeners/jobs or `async void` lifetime callbacks;
- distinguishing caller cancellation from a timeout with an exception filter;
- performing bounded best-effort cleanup after the original operation was cancelled.

Never add a broad `catch (Exception)` merely to return `Result.Fail`; use `Result.Try`. If a framework boundary must catch broadly, log the exception and ensure it cannot escape that boundary.

### Handle cancellation before failure

When a called method can be cancelled, always check `IsCancelled` before checking `IsFailed`. Cancellation may also satisfy failure predicates, but expected cancellation must not be handled or logged as an ordinary error.

Always call `LogWarning()` on a cancelled result and return that result:

```csharp
var result = await RunOperation(cancellationToken);
if (result.IsCancelled)
    return result.LogWarning();

if (result.IsFailed)
    return result.LogError();

return result;
```

Do **not** use `cancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested()` to propagate a cancelled `Result`. Check `result.IsCancelled`, call `LogWarning()`, and return the cancelled result instead. This preserves FluentResults cancellation semantics and avoids turning a handled cancellation back into exception control flow.

For methods that return `Result<T>`, follow the same rule and return the original cancelled generic result whenever the signature permits. If a framework callback cannot return `Result`, inspect and warning-log the cancelled result, then exit the callback cleanly.

### Always log failed results

Every failed, non-cancelled result must pass through `LogError()` at the handling or return boundary:

```csharp
if (result.IsCancelled)
    return result.LogWarning();

if (result.IsFailed)
    return result.LogError();
```

Apply this to generic results and merged results as well. Inspect and log the result before reading `.Value`. Never silently discard a failed command, event publication, scheduler operation, notification, database operation, or cleanup result.

Avoid these patterns:

```csharp
// Wrong: cancellation is treated as an ordinary error.
if (result.IsFailed)
    return result.LogError();

// Wrong: cancellation is converted back into exception control flow.
if (result.IsCancelled)
    cancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();

// Wrong: a failed result is propagated without logging.
return result;

// Wrong: Result.Try should own this exception boundary.
try
{
    await DoWorkAsync(cancellationToken);
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    return Result.Fail(ex.Message);
}
```

### Result composition and propagation

- Return the original failed or cancelled result when signatures are compatible; this preserves error types and metadata.
- Use `ToResult()` only when converting `Result<T>` to non-generic `Result` is required.
- Use `Result.Merge(...)` for independent result-producing operations, then apply the same cancellation-first and failure-logging checks to the merged result.
- Never read `.Value` until success is established.
- Do not replace structured errors with only `error.Message`; retain `ExceptionalError`, HTTP/status metadata, and domain error types.
- Use existing `ResultExtensions` helpers for validation, not-found, conflict, timeout, and other expected failures so API metadata remains intact.
- Do not use `LogIfFailed()` where cancellation and ordinary failure require different severity; branch on `IsCancelled` first.
- Avoid duplicate logging at every stack frame. Log at the boundary that handles or returns the result, and always log results consumed locally rather than propagated.
- When using `Result.Try`, inspect its returned result. Do not assume wrapping an operation is sufficient by itself.

### Cancellation-token use with Results

Pass the caller's token through async work for which cancellation is useful, including long-running EF Core queries, scheduler calls, command/event dispatch, SignalR calls, HTTP calls, file operations, and delays. Cancellation must be observable by cancellable work, but once represented as a cancelled `Result`, propagate it as a result rather than throwing.

Do not pass a `CancellationToken` to simple database queries that return a single result and are expected to complete immediately. Cancellation adds no useful behavior to operations such as a straightforward `FirstOrDefaultAsync(...)`, `SingleOrDefaultAsync(...)`, `FindAsync(...)`, `AnyAsync(...)`, or similarly trivial scalar/key lookup. Prefer the overload without a token for these queries. Continue passing a token to genuinely expensive queries, projections over substantial data, batch operations, writes, transactions, and other work where cancellation can meaningfully interrupt execution.

`CancellationToken.None` is intentional and must be respected. It may be used for work that must not be cancelled, including required state transitions or framework-owned operations whose completion is necessary for consistency. Do not mechanically replace `CancellationToken.None` with a caller token. Evaluate the operation's cancellation semantics first, and preserve `CancellationToken.None` where non-cancellability is deliberate.

After cancellation has been accepted, terminal-state persistence may need a separate cleanup token so an already-cancelled request or job token does not prevent recording `Cancelled`, `Paused`, or another durable state. Use `CancellationToken.None` when that persistence must complete and the operation is known to be short and bounded by its underlying infrastructure. For potentially blocking or externally dependent cleanup, prefer a separate short timeout token. Such cleanup must:
- be contained at the framework boundary so cleanup exceptions cannot escape;
- log cleanup timeout/cancellation as a warning;
- log other cleanup failures as errors;
- avoid an unbounded token only when the operation could block indefinitely.

## Code File and Folder Creation Rule

When backend work creates a new code file that requires a new folder, the folder creation is not complete until two things are true:

1. The new code file namespace uses only the owning project's root namespace.
2. The owning project's `.csproj.DotSettings` file has the new folder path registered in `NamespaceFoldersToSkip` with `True`.

Folders should never account for the namespace. Do not append folder names to the namespace of new backend code files.

Example:

If creating a new code file at:

```text
src/AppHost/Startup/HealthChecks/MyHealthCheck.cs
```

and `Startup/HealthChecks` is a new folder path for that project, the code file namespace should stay at the project root namespace:

```csharp
namespace Reaparr.AppHost;
```

Do not use a folder-derived namespace:

```csharp
namespace Reaparr.AppHost.Startup.HealthChecks;
```

Also update the owning project `.csproj.DotSettings` with an entry matching the existing encoding style, for example:

```xml
<s:Boolean x:Key="/Default/CodeInspection/NamespaceProvider/NamespaceFoldersToSkip/=startup_005Chealthchecks/@EntryIndexedValue">True</s:Boolean>
```

Rules:
- Applies to any backend code file creation that introduces a new folder.
- Applies to production backend projects and backend test projects.
- Use the owning project's `.csproj.DotSettings` file.
- Inspect existing entries in that file and copy the same casing and `_005C` path separator encoding style.
- Do not hardcode project paths from examples; determine the owning project from where the new file is being created.

## Backend Workflow

1. Load `reaparr-backend`; this is not optional for backend work.
2. Confirm the task is backend-scoped and load any narrower matching skills.
3. Use native search and symbol tools to find existing precedent.
4. Identify the owning project and, for tests, the matching test project.
5. Make the smallest maintainable change that fixes the root cause.
6. Preserve project boundaries; place shared contracts in `*.Contracts` projects only when cross-project consumption requires it.
7. Keep behavior deterministic, especially in tests and background jobs.
8. Before finishing any backend code file creation, check whether a new folder was introduced. If yes, use the root project namespace in the code file and update the owning `.csproj.DotSettings` `NamespaceFoldersToSkip` entry.
9. Re-read changed files after edits to confirm the intended changes landed.
10. Use native diagnostics and language-server analysis to find errors that need fixing before claiming completion. Do not run a build as an error-discovery mechanism.

## Apply Backend Changes (Native Development)

Run the backend with the repository's native command:

```bash
dotnet run --project src/AppHost
```

Use the process tool for long-running services, observe readiness before exercising the service, and stop the process after verification.

## Run and Test Commands

Do not run `dotnet build` or project build commands solely to discover errors. Use `lsp` diagnostics and targeted native checks first. Build-related execution is allowed when it is part of running tests or the requested application workflow.

### Preferred test execution: dotnet-test-mcp

When `dotnet-test-mcp` is available, prefer it for backend test execution. Otherwise use the repository's native test command from the project configuration.

| Action | Tool |
| --- | --- |
| List test projects | `dotnet-test-mcp:list_test_projects` |
| List tests summary | `dotnet-test-mcp:list_tests_summary` |
| Run single test | `dotnet-test-mcp:run_single_test` |
| Run test class | `dotnet-test-mcp:run_all_tests_in_class` |
| Run test project | `dotnet-test-mcp:run_all_tests_for_project` |
| Run all tests | `dotnet-test-mcp:run_all_tests` |

Use direct calls to the documented test tool after one successful health check. If it is unavailable, use the repository's native test command and preserve the failure evidence.

All backend test execution should use the documented test route. Never use an external editor run configuration for test execution.

### Running the backend AppHost (not test-related)

```bash
dotnet run --project src/AppHost
```

## Verification Gates

Never rely on a build alone to determine whether backend code has errors. Use native language-server diagnostics, project diagnostics, and targeted tests.

Required error-checking flow:
1. Run `lsp` diagnostics for each changed backend file when a language server is available.
2. If diagnostics are incomplete or fail, retry with narrower file ranges and repository-native checks.
3. Fix all relevant reported errors.
4. Only after diagnostics are clean, run tests when the change requires behavioral verification.

Build commands are not a substitute for diagnostics. Use them only when required by the requested workflow or as part of test execution.

Allowed build-related execution:
- Running backend unit tests.
- Running backend integration tests.
- Running a test project may compile as part of test execution; that is acceptable because the purpose is executing tests, not discovering compile errors.

Test routing:
- Command/handler or service changes: diagnostics first, then relevant unit tests when behavior changed.
- Unit test changes: diagnostics first, then the relevant unit test project, preferably filtered first and broader if risk warrants.
- Integration test changes or integration failures: diagnostics first, then targeted integration tests, then the full integration suite before claiming done.
- Cross-project or public contract changes: diagnostics across affected files and symbols first, then affected tests.
- Job, SignalR, EF Core, or endpoint changes: diagnostics first, then tests covering the runtime path when available; otherwise explain the missing behavioral verifier.

Do not claim success unless native diagnostics and required tests passed. If the language server is unavailable, state that explicitly and use the strongest available native checks.

## Common Mistakes

- Skipping this umbrella skill and loading only a narrow backend skill.
- Editing backend unit tests without also loading `reaparr-backend-unit-tests`.
- Testing filesystem behavior with real `File`, `Directory`, temp directories, or host filesystem state instead of `BaseUnitTest.SetupFileSystem(...)` and `MockFileSystem`.
- Treating this skill as optional for small changes.
- Using external editor integrations instead of native repository tools.
- Switching to broad filesystem commands after one native-tool hiccup instead of retrying with a narrower request.
- Running `dotnet build` or a project build to discover compile errors instead of using native diagnostics.
- Creating backend code files in new folders without keeping the namespace at the project root and updating the owning `.csproj.DotSettings` `NamespaceFoldersToSkip` entry.
- Creating new abstractions before checking existing Reaparr patterns.
- Putting shared command records in implementation projects when they belong in `*.Contracts`.
- Returning raw values or `null` from Result-based command handlers.
- Letting Quartz job exceptions escape.
- Weakening tests or assertions to force green.
- Using `--filter` or `--treenode-filter` shell arguments for test discovery — use the documented test tooling instead.
- Running frontend package managers for backend-only work.
- Blocking test execution on unavailable `dotnet-test-mcp`; use the repository's native test command when the MCP test route is unavailable.
